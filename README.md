# MachineLearningTrading

My adventures in applying machine learning to the trading world.

The first few experiments used the BittrexApi to trade crypto currencies however I found that this was not reliable enough as it missed a few timestamps here and there

The current iteration of experiments use the AlphaVantage Api which can be used for Crypto, FX and other exchanges
